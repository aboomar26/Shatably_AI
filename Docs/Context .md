# Clarifying Questions

1. User Identification & Context
    - How do you want to identify users for chat context? (e.g., via login, session token, anonymous with device ID, etc.)
    - Should chat history be persistent across devices or only per session?
2. Data Store Preferences
    - Do you have a preferred data store for chat context? (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, or a simple file-based approach for now?)
    - Is scalability or multi-user concurrency a concern at this stage?
3. Environment Variables Management
    - Should the environment variables JSON file support multiple environments (dev, prod, test), or is a single config sufficient for now?
    - Do you want secrets (API keys) in this JSON, or should they be loaded from a more secure source (e.g., OS env vars, .env file)?
4. Image Generation Endpoint
    - Should the image generation endpoint be unified with the chat endpoint, or remain a separate API?
    - Is there a need for user context/history in image generation, or is it always stateless?
5. LLM Providers
    - Will you always use Gemini and Nebius/OpenAI, or should the system be designed to easily swap/add providers in the future?
    - Should the provider be selectable per request, or is it fixed per endpoint?
6. API Security
    - Should the API be open (as now) or do you want to add authentication (API keys, OAuth, etc.)?
7. Error Handling & Logging
    - Do you want structured logging and error tracking (e.g., Sentry, log files), or is simple console logging sufficient for now?
8. Testing & CI/CD
    - Should the system design include automated tests or CI/CD setup, or is that out of scope for now?


## answers 
1. the app will identify users based on a user id will be sent on every request 
2. i want a simple approach for now (one conversation per user)
3. i mean with environment variables as .env files that holds the secrets of the application but here will act also as datastore for the variables that does changes on user demand like the llm provider api key, system instructions, genesartion config,  model info, CORS config (chack the app for what i mean)
4. a separate API approach 
5.no lets keep it as it is for now but i prefer if there an option for swapping the provider only if it does not require new library or adding any other compecation on the application.
6. open for now 
7. no 
8. no

# here are a few final clarifications to ensure the design is optimal:
1. Data Store Location:
    - Should user chat histories be stored in a single JSON file (mapping user_id to history), or as separate files per user (e.g., history_    {user_id}.json)?
    - Should the .env file be updated by the app at runtime, or only by manual/user/admin action?
2. Config Update API:
    - Do you want an endpoint to update config values (e.g., change LLM API key or system instructions via API), or will this always be done by editing the .env file directly?
3. CORS Config:
    - Should CORS origins be dynamically updatable via config, or is it sufficient to set them at startup from the .env file?4. 
4. Model Info & Generation Config:
    - Should these be user-specific (e.g., each user can have their own model/config), or global for the whole app?


## answers
1. no each user has its history file 
2. this always be done by editing the .env file directly
3. i want the simplist option that will write much code 
4. global for whole application and the developer who will choose them
