# Shatably AI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Shatably AI application based on the simplified system design. The plan focuses on creating a streamlined codebase with minimal folder structure while maintaining all required functionality.

## Simplified File Structure

```
/Shatably_AI/
├── main.py                 # Application entry point with FastAPI setup
├── .env                    # Environment variables
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
├── chat.py                 # Chat functionality with Gemini integration
├── photo.py                # Image generation functionality (already exists)
└── utils.py                # Utility functions for history management
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- Create `.env` file with necessary configuration
- Update `requirements.txt` with required dependencies

### 2. Utility Functions (utils.py)

- Implement chat history management functions
- Add helper functions for file operations

### 3. Chat Functionality (chat.py)

- Implement Gemini API integration
- Create chat endpoint with history management
- Add user identification handling

### 4. Main Application (main.py)

- Set up FastAPI application
- Configure CORS middleware
- Include routes from chat.py and photo.py

### 5. Testing

- Test chat functionality
- Test image generation functionality
- Verify proper error handling

## Timeline

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Environment Setup | 1 hour |
| Utility Functions | 2 hours |
| Chat Functionality | 3 hours |
| Main Application | 1 hour |
| Testing | 2 hours |
| **Total** | **9 hours** |

## Dependencies

- FastAPI for API framework
- Google Generative AI for chat functionality
- OpenAI/Nebius for image generation (already implemented in photo.py)
- Python-dotenv for environment variable management
- Uvicorn for ASGI server

## Next Steps After Approval

Once this implementation plan is approved, we will proceed with the following steps:

1. Create the `.env` file with required configuration
2. Implement `utils.py` for history management
3. Develop `chat.py` with Gemini integration
4. Update `main.py` to include all routes
5. Test the complete application

## Notes

- The existing `photo.py` file will be integrated as-is into the application
- All functionality will be maintained despite the simplified structure
- The application will be designed for easy maintenance and future enhancements
