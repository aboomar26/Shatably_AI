# Progress: Shatably AI

## What Works
- Full application structure is implemented and functional
- Chat functionality with Gemini integration and history management
- Robust image generation via direct Nebius API integration
- RESTful API endpoints for chat and image generation
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the system
- Environment variable configuration for flexible deployment
- Setup script for Windows environment

## Current Status
- Application is in a stable, functional state
- Image generation module has been refactored for improved reliability
  - Modular design with separate request preparation and response processing
  - Direct HTTP requests using httpx instead of OpenAI client
  - Comprehensive error handling at multiple levels
- Core features (chat and image generation) are fully implemented and tested
- API structure follows RESTful design with proper error responses
- Configuration through environment variables is established and documented
- System design documentation has been updated to reflect current implementation

## Known Issues
- No active issues at this time (all previous image generation errors have been resolved)

## What's Left to Build
- Formal testing framework and test coverage
- User authentication system (if required)
- Additional image generation options (different models, styles, etc.)
- Frontend client application improvements (if needed)
- Deployment pipeline for production environments
- Additional API documentation for frontend developers

## Next Development Priorities
1. Implement automated testing for improved reliability
2. Monitor performance and optimize as needed
3. Explore advanced Nebius API features for enhanced image generation
4. Consider adding caching mechanisms for improved response times
