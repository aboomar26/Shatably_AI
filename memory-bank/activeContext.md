# Active Context: Shatably AI

## Current Focus
- Refining and stabilizing the image generation module
- Improving error handling throughout the system
- Maintaining clean, modular code structure
- Updating system documentation to reflect implementation changes

## Recent Changes
- Refactored image generation (photo.py) to use direct HTTP requests instead of OpenAI client
- Implemented modular design with separate functions for request preparation and response processing
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the API chain
- Fixed 500 Internal Server Error issues in the image generation endpoint
- Updated SystemDesign.md document to reflect current implementation

## Active Decisions
- Using direct httpx requests for Nebius API integration rather than OpenAI client
- Maintaining separation of concerns with modular function design
- Implementing detailed error handling at multiple levels
- Structuring code for maintainability and future extensions

## Next Steps
- Consider adding unit and integration tests for robustness
- Explore potential enhancements to image generation capabilities
- Evaluate performance optimization opportunities
- Document API usage examples for frontend integration

## Current Considerations
- Balancing code simplicity with comprehensive error handling
- Ensuring consistent API response formats across endpoints
- Maintaining proper environment variable management
- Preparing for potential scaling requirements in the future
